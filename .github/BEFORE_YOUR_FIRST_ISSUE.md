## Installation

To run the Kindly application locally:

Clone the project:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/enBloc-org/kindly.git
```

Go to the project directory:

```bash
  cd kindly
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
  npm install
```

Add env variables:

The .env.example file in the root directory shows what variables you will need. For Gmail app and AWS amplify variables you will need to ask for them on discord. To be added to the Supabase team again ask on Dicord. For Supabase variables you will need to have access to the project within Supabase (https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/secrets).

Running the app:

```bash
  npm run dev
```
